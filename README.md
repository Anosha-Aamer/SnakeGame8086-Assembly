# SnakeGame8086-Assembly
Classic Snake game implemented in x86 Assembly language using DOS interrupts and BIOS calls for video and keyboard handling.



# SnakeGame8086

A classic Snake Game implemented entirely in x86 Assembly language for DOS environments. This project demonstrates low-level programming concepts using BIOS interrupt calls for keyboard input and screen output.

---

## Features

- Classic Snake gameplay with easy controls using arrow keys.
- Real-time screen rendering using BIOS video interrupts.
- Random food generation ensuring non-overlapping placement.
- Score tracking and display.
- Collision detection with walls and self.
- Game over screen with options to restart or exit.
- Written for 8086 architecture (runs in DOS emulators like DOSBox).
